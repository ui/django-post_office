==================
Django Post Office
==================

Django Post Office is a simple app that allows you to log email activities and
asynchronously send emails in django. Supports HTML email.

The concept is similar to `django-mailer <https://github.com/jtauber/django-mailer>`_ and
`django-mailer-2 <https://github.com/SmileyChris/django-mailer-2>`_. I maintained `my own fork of
django-mailer-2 here <https://github.com/selwin/django-mailer>`_ until I decided to make one from scratch
because I wanted a cleaner code base.

``post_office`` is implemented as a Django ``EmailBackend`` so you don't need to
change any of your code to start sending email asynchronously.


Dependencies
============

* `django >= 1.2 <http://djangoproject.com/>`_


Installation
============

* Install via pypi::

    pip install django-post_office

* Add ``post_office`` to your INSTALLED_APPS in django's ``settings.py``::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        # other apps
        "post_office",
    )

* Run ``syncdb``::

    python manage.py syncdb

* Set ``post_office.EmailBackend`` as your ``EMAIL_BACKEND`` in django's ``settings.py``::

    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'post_office.EmailBackend'


Usage
=====

If you use ``post_office``'s ``EmailBackend``, it will automatically queue emails sent using
django's ``send_mail`` in the database.

To actually send them out, run ``python manage.py send_queued_mail``. You can schedule this
to run regularly via cron::

    * * * * * (/usr/bin/python manage.py send_queued_mail >> send_mail.log 2>&1)


By default, ``post_office`` uses django's SMTP ``EmailBackend``. If you want to
use a different backend, you can do so by changing ``POST_OFFICE_BACKEND``.

For example if you want to use `django-ses <https://github.com/hmarr/django-ses>`_::

    POST_OFFICE_BACKEND = 'django_ses.SESBackend'

You can view also queued emails along with their statuses if you have django's
admin interface enabled::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        # ...
        'django.contrib.admin',
        # ...
    )

Management Commands
-------------------

* ``send_queued_mail`` - send queued emails, those that aren't successfully
  sent they will be marked as ``failed``.

* ``cleanup_mail`` - delete all emails created before an X number of days
  (defaults to 90).

You may want to set these up via cron to run regularly::

    * * * * * (cd $PROJECT; python manage.py send_queued_mail >> $PROJECT/cron_mail.log 2>&1)
    0 1 * * * (cd $PROJECT; python manage.py cleanup_mail --days=30 >> $PROJECT/cron_mail_cleanup.log 2>&1)

Lower Level Usage
-----------------

``post_office`` also comes with a ``send_mail`` command similar to django's.
It accepts two extra arguments, ``html_message`` and
``priority`` (``high``, ``medium``, ``low`` or ``now``).

Here's how to use it::

    from post_office import send_mail, PRIORITY
    send_mail('subject', 'plaintext message', 'from@example.com', ['to@example.com'],
              '<p>HTML message</p>', priority=PRIORITY.medium)

``post_office`` is also task queue friendly. Passing ``now`` as priority into
``send_mail`` will deliver the email right away, regardless of how many emails
you have in your queue::

    from post_office import send_mail, PRIORITY
    send_mail('subject', 'plaintext message', 'from@example.com', ['to@example.com'],
              '<p>HTML message</p>', priority=PRIORITY.now)

This is useful if you already use something like `django-rq <https://github.com/ui/django-rq>`_
to send emails asynchronously and only need to store email activities and logs.


Templated email
---------------
``post_office`` now supports templated email from database with basic caching support.
``post_office`` will create a database table to store your email templates that can be used to send emails with context.

Basic usage::

    1. Create EmailTemplate from django administration panel

    2. From your code or shell, you can use the template to create an Email object and add them to the email queue

        from post_office.utils import send_templated_mail
        send_templated_mail(template_name, 'from@example.com', ['to@example.com'],
            context={'name': 'AwesomeBoy'}, priority=PRIORITY.medium)

    3. Caching for templated email is turned ON by default

        ## Enable caching support for post_office templated email
        ## All cache key will be prefixed by post_office:template:
        ## To turn OFF caching, you need to explicitly set POST_OFFICE_CACHE to False in settings
        POST_OFFICE_CACHE = False

        ## This is optional, if 'post_office' key is non existent, it will use 'default' key for cache backend
        CACHES = {
                    'post_office': {
                        'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.memcached.PyLibMCCache',
                        'LOCATION': '127.0.0.1:11211',
                    }
                }

Testing
=======


To run ``post_office``'s test suite::

    django-admin.py test post_office --settings=post_office.tests.settings --pythonpath=.
