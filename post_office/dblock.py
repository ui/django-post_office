class db_lock:
    """
    An entity that can lock a shared resource and release it through database locking.
    Locks can be acquired by different hosts, since the source of truth is handled by the database.

    Usage:

    ```
    # Lock a critical section of code
    with db_lock('my_lock', timedelta(seconds=30)):
        do_something()
    ```
    The section inside the ``with`` statement will run for a maximum of 30 seconds. If that
    time elapses before leaving the block, a ``TimeoutException`` is raised.

    If another process attempts to run a critical section of code, using the same resource
    identifier while the above block is running, a ``LockedException`` is raised.

    ```
    # Blocking variant of the above
    with db_lock('my_lock', wait=True):
        do_something()
    ```
    By using the parameter ``wait=True``, the critical section of code is only entered after
    mutexes from other processes have been released. A ``LockedException`` will not be raised.

    ```
    # Running critical section until it expires
    with db_lock('my_lock') as lock:
        while lock.remaining_time > timedelta(seconds=1):
            do_something()  # never requires more than one second
    ```
    By querying the remaining time left over for the acquisition of the lock, one can
    avoid a ``TimeoutException`` to be raised.

    ```
    # Use a decorator to mark a whole function as critical
    @db_lock('my_lock')
    def do_something():
        # do something here
    ```
    This function may raise a ``LockedException`` or a ``TimeoutException``.

    ```
    # Lock critical section of code explicitly
    lock = db_lock('my_lock')
    lock.acquire()
    do_something()
    lock.release()
    ```
    A lock can also be acquired and released explicitly. This is error-prone, because it relies
    upon releasing the lock.
